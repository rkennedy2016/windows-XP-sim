# Windows XP Chaos Simulation 🚀💀

## **🔴 WARNING:** This simulation is **ABSOLUTE CHAOS**

✅ **MEMZ.exe triggers a slow BSOD with fake errors**  
✅ **Glitch effects before XP collapses**  
✅ **Pop-ups saying `"Reality.exe has stopped responding"`**  
✅ **Cursor disappears when Nyan Cat takes over**
